OpenSourceRPG
=============

This project is somewhat of a hybrid -- it takes ideas from both SpaceEscape and another Android project I have done (both can be found in Github and BitBucket, respectively). This is mainly used as practice for C++, but I would love to see it take off as a fun game to develop over time.
